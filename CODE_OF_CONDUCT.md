# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

The Privacy Activist Kit is committed to providing a safe and welcoming environment for everyone who wants to learn about and contribute to digital privacy and security. We expect all community members to treat each other with respect and dignity.

## Our Values

This project exists to empower people to protect their digital rights and privacy. We believe that:

- **Privacy is a human right** that should be accessible to everyone
- **Collaboration works best** when everyone feels safe to contribute, ask questions, and share knowledge
- **Respect is fundamental** to building trust and creating meaningful change

## Expected Behavior

We expect all community members, contributors, and maintainers to:

- **Be respectful and considerate** in all interactions
- **Be patient with beginners** and remember that everyone started somewhere
- **Give and receive constructive feedback** gracefully and with good intent
- **Focus on what is best for the community** and the project's mission
- **Respect different threat models and privacy needs** without judgment
- **Maintain confidentiality** when discussing sensitive security topics
- **Credit the work of others** and respect intellectual property

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are unacceptable in our community:

- **Harassment or discrimination** of any kind
- **Trolling, insulting comments, or personal attacks**
- **Publishing others' private information** without explicit permission (doxing)

All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality.
