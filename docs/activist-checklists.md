     - No tracking or data collection
  2. **Apple Maps** (good privacy)
     - Download offline maps  
     - Better privacy than Google Maps
  3. **Printed directions**
     - Print from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
     - Use [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) for extra privacy

  **Scouting Security:**
  - Disable location services completely
  - Keep phone in airplane mode

## 📱 Secondary Phone Checklist

*How to set up an alternate phone for actions and activism that has less data. For anyone who is higher risk of arrest who wants to invest in protecting their data.*

::: details &nbsp; [ ] &nbsp;**Understand 'Burner Phone' vs 'Secondary Phone'**
  

  **Burner phone:** Truly anonymous, disconnected from identity, used few times before discarding - requires great effort for true anonymity. 

  **Secondary phone:** Second phone with minimal info in case of confiscation, reusable over many actions. Goal is harm reduction, not anonymity. 

  **Consider if you are:**
  - An organizer/leader in social movement spaces
  - Likely to be targeted based on identity (POC, LGBTQ+, documentation status, etc.)  
  - Working with targeted communities
  - Someone with very sensitive data on your phone
:::

::: details &nbsp; [ ] &nbsp;**What data am I protecting?**
  

  Your phone contains: all contacts (friends, family, organizers/activists), location data and map history (can determine where you've been and who you've met), message history (texts, Signal, WhatsApp), years of email history, browser history/bookmarks/passwords, all photos (including of other people without their consent), calendar events (meetings - who, when, where), documents (Google docs, encrypted tools if signed in).

  **Data at Risk:**
  - **Contacts:** Everyone in your phone becomes visible to authorities
  - **Location History:** Shows everywhere you've been and who you've met with
  - **Messages:** Texts, Signal, WhatsApp conversations going back years
  - **Photos:** Including photos of others who didn't consent to seizure
  - **Calendar:** Meeting details reveal organizing activities  
  - **Browser Data:** Search history, bookmarks, saved passwords
  - **Documents:** Google Docs, encrypted tools if logged in
:::

::: details &nbsp; [ ] &nbsp;**What you'll need**
  

  **Equipment & Costs:**
  - Secondary smartphone (used or new): $60+ or free if donated
  - SIM card: $5  
  - Prepaid plan: ~$15/month (cheapest) or $100/year (best long-term)

  **Time & Difficulty:**
  - Setup time: 3 hours
  - Technical difficulty: Moderate  
  - Maintenance: 30 minutes after each use
:::

::: details &nbsp; [ ] &nbsp;**How to set up the phone**
  

  Factory reset device if used. Skip/decline all optional setup (phone, location tracking, analytics, cloud backup). **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT sign in with normal Apple/Google Account during setup - look for 'skip' button. Activate phone BEFORE making Apple/Google account since they require phone number and you want to use new number.

  **Setup Process:**
  1. Factory reset device ([iPhone](https://support.apple.com/HT201274) / [Android](https://support.google.com/android/answer/6088915))
  2. **Skip ALL optional features:**
     - Location tracking
     - Analytics/usage data  
     - Cloud backup
     - Account sign-in (look for "Skip" buttons)
  3. **⚠️ Critical:** Never sign in with your main Apple/Google account
  4. Activate phone first, then create new accounts
:::

::: details &nbsp; [ ] &nbsp;**How to set up separate Signal profile**
  

  Follow standard Signal activation for new number, then set up username. Tell contacts your new Signal username by messaging from main Signal first to verify identity. Message your main Signal from new one to send info between accounts with disappearing messages on. Join minimal relevant groups and leave when no longer active/relevant.

  **Signal Setup:**
  1. Install Signal with new phone number
  2. Set up username (e.g., @cloudy.52)
  3. **Verify identity:** Message contacts from main Signal first
  4. **Bridge accounts:** Message between your two Signals  
  5. **Minimize exposure:** Join only essential groups
  6. **Clean up:** Leave groups when no longer needed

  **⚠️ Remember:** Every Signal group provides more data if phone is confiscated.
:::

::: details &nbsp; [ ] &nbsp;**Before and after each action**
  

  **Before each action:** - Ensure phone number active and not expired
  - Check minutes/data remaining if not unlimited plan
  - Charge phone
  - Download offline maps

  **After each action:** - Clear all app data (messages, Browse, maps)
  - Remove Signal threads and leave unneeded groups  
  - Clear browser/navigation history
  - **If confiscated:** Consider selling and getting new phone (factory reset may not remove spyware)
:::

## ✊ Prepare for a Protest

*Protect yourself and your community while protesting or attending any kind of action where arrest risk and surveillance is higher.*

::: details &nbsp; [ ] &nbsp;**If arrest risk is going up, turn your phone off!**
  

  When fully powered off, phone is more secure against data extraction by police. Data stays encrypted until you turn on and enter passcode for first time. The number one protection is turning phone off if you think you're getting closer to a risky situation. Remind others to turn off phones too. 

  **iPhone tip:** Press screen lock button 5 times to quickly bring up 'power off' option.

  **Why this works:** When powered off completely, your phone's data remains encrypted and is much harder for police to access.
:::

::: details &nbsp; [ ] &nbsp;**How to disable GPS location tracking**
  

  **iPhone:** Settings > Privacy & Security > Disable 'Location Services' (Shortcut: Say to Siri 'Disable location tracking'). 

  **Android:** Settings > Location > Disable 'Use Location'. 

  Print maps or save offline maps for phone use. Leave smart watches or Bluetooth trackers at home or disable their tracking.

  **Additional Steps:**
  - Print directions from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
  - Download offline maps in [Organic Maps](https://organicmaps.app/)
  - Remove/disable smartwatches, AirTags, Tile trackers
  - Consider putting devices in a Faraday bag
:::

::: details &nbsp; [ ] &nbsp;**How to change your passcode**
  

  Generate a random 10-digit passcode (don't make one up yourself). 

  **iPhone:** Settings > Face ID & Passcode > Change Passcode > Passcode Options > Custom Numeric Code. 

  **Android:** Settings > Security > Screen Lock > Enter Current Lock > PIN/Password > Choose 10-digit Passcode. 

  Write new passcode on paper, keep it safe until memorized.

  **⚠️ Important:** Use a truly random passcode - humans are terrible at making up random numbers.
:::

::: details &nbsp; [ ] &nbsp;**How to disable face/fingerprint unlock**
  

  **iPhone:** Settings > Face ID & Passcode > Disable 'Use Face ID for iPhone Unlock' (can leave rest enabled). 

  **Android:** Settings > Lock Screen (or Security) > Biometrics and Security > Disable both 'Face Recognition' and 'Fingerprint Unlock' for phone unlocking.

  **Why this matters:** Police can potentially force you to unlock with biometrics, but cannot force you to reveal your passcode.
:::

::: details &nbsp; [ ] &nbsp;**How to install and use Signal**
  

  Install Signal on phone. Message/call existing contacts using phone number or ask for their Signal username - they must have Signal installed too. Enable disappearing messages and disable notifications showing content.

  **Quick Setup:**
  1. Install [Signal](https://signal.org/download/)
  2. Connect with existing contacts

:::

::: details &nbsp; [ ] &nbsp;**How to take photos while protecting identities**
  

  Try not to capture faces when possible. Disable automatic cloud uploads (Google Photos, iCloud Photos) so you can review before uploading. If you capture faces, use the blurring tool in Signal when sending anywhere. If organizing with a known group, discuss documentation and sharing agreements in advance.

  **Photo Security:**
  - **Prevention:** Avoid capturing faces when possible
  - **Cloud uploads:** Disable automatic backup to review first
  - **Face protection:** Use Signal's blur tool before sharing
  - **Group agreements:** Discuss photo/video protocols in advance
  - **Consider:** Photos may be used to identify and target others
:::

::: details &nbsp; [ ] &nbsp;**How to use private navigation**
  

  Turn off location services before leaving for the action. Keep the phone in airplane mode as much as possible so the carrier doesn't know your location. Use printed directions if possible - print from OpenStreetMap via Tor Browser for privacy. Use the Organic Maps app for private mapping - open it before leaving to download offline maps.

  **Navigation Options (most to least private):**
  1. **Printed directions** (most secure)
     - Print from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
     - Access via [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) for extra privacy
  2. **Organic Maps** with offline maps
     - Download maps before leaving home
     - Works without an internet connection
  3. **Airplane mode** + saved maps
     - Prevents cell tower tracking
     - Still allows offline navigation
:::

::: details &nbsp; [ ] &nbsp;**How to select phone number for arrest**
  

  Decide who to call if you're arrested. If there's no active jail support hotline in your area, pick an emergency contact (a friend/trusted comrade for legal support - get their consent in advance). For higher-risk actions, organizers may have established a specific legal hotline. Larger cities may have an NLG jail support hotline. Write the legal number on your body in sharpie where it won't rub off (upper arm, leg, torso).

  **Emergency Contact Options:**
  1. **Jail support hotline** (if available in your area)
  2. **Trusted friend/comrade** with legal knowledge
  3. **National Lawyers Guild** hotline (major cities)
  4. **Action-specific** legal support number

  **⚠️ Remember:** Get consent from personal contacts in advance.

  **Write number on body:** Use a Sharpie on your upper arm, leg, or torso where it won't rub off.

::: details &nbsp; [ ] &nbsp;**How to review location permissions**
  

  **iPhone:** Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services. Review each app: Never (best for most), Ask Next Time (rarely needed), While Using App (essential navigation only), Always (almost no app needs this). Set Photos to Never to avoid revealing location in sent photos. Disable System Services > Significant Locations. 

  **Android:** Settings > Privacy > Permission manager > Location. You'll see similar options: Don't allow, Ask every time, Allow only while using, Allow all the time.

  **Permission Levels (most to least secure):**

  **iPhone:**
  - **Never** (best for most apps)
  - **Ask Next Time** (for rarely needed location)
  - **While Using App** (essential navigation only) 
  - **Always** (almost no app should have this)

  **Android:** - **Don't allow** (best for most apps)
  - **Ask every time** (for rarely needed location)
  - **Allow only while using app** (essential navigation only)
  - **Allow all the time** (almost no app should have this)

  **⚠️ Critical:** Set the Photos app to "Never" to prevent location data from being included in shared photos.

::: details &nbsp; [ ] &nbsp;**How to set up two-factor authentication**
  

  Install an authenticator app: 1Password (which has a built-in authenticator) or Ente Auth. Optional: Create an account for backup (Ente encrypts your data). Set up 2FA on your accounts: Go to the Security/Privacy settings and look for '2FA'/'two-factor'/'multi-factor authentication'. Select the 'authenticator app' option if it's available (and save the backup codes in your password manager). If only SMS is available, use that. Common sites to secure include Google, Apple ID, Facebook, Twitter/X, and Instagram.

  **Authenticator Apps:**
  1. **1Password** (if you have it) - Built-in authenticator
  2. **[Ente Auth](https://ente.io/auth/)** - Privacy-focused, end-to-end encrypted
  3. **Avoid:** SMS when possible (it can be intercepted)

  **Setup Process:**
  1. Go to your account's Security/Privacy settings
  2. Look for "2FA," "Two-factor," or "Multi-factor authentication"  
  3. **Choose "Authenticator app"** over SMS when available
  4. **Save backup codes** in your password manager
  5. Test the login with your new setup

  **Essential Accounts to Secure:**
  - Email accounts (Gmail, etc.)
  - [Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915)
  - Social media accounts
  - Financial accounts
  - Work accounts

  **📚 Check which sites support 2FA:** [2FA Directory](https://2fa.directory/)

::: details &nbsp; [ ] &nbsp;**How to use Proton Mail**
  

  Sign up for a free ProtonMail account. Choose a random username that's not connected to your identity. When verifying that you're human, choose 'CAPTCHA,' not 'email.' When asked for a recovery method, choose 'Maybe later' (but you must save your password securely). Messages between Proton users are automatically end-to-end encrypted. Messages to other providers are not encrypted, but you can send a password-protected email.

  **Setup Steps:**
  1. Sign up for a free [ProtonMail](https://proton.me/mail) account
  2. **Username:** Choose a random name unconnected to your identity
  3. **Verification:** Choose "CAPTCHA," not "email"  
  4. **Recovery method:** Choose "Maybe later" (save your password safely!)
  5. **⚠️ Important:** You must secure your password since there's no recovery option

  **Encryption Levels:**
  - **Proton to Proton:** Automatic end-to-end encryption
  - **Proton to others:** Not encrypted, but you can send a password-protected message
  - **Still beneficial:** It's harder for the government to access via backdoors
