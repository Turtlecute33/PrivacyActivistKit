## Content Guidelines

When contributing content to the Privacy Activist Kit, please follow these principles:

### Voice and Tone

- **Clear and accessible**: Write for a general audience, not just technical experts
- **Direct and practical**: Focus on actionable advice people can implement
- **Empowering, not preachy**: Help people make informed choices without judgment
- **Honest about trade-offs**: Privacy often involves balancing security, convenience, and usability

- **Keep it current**: Privacy tools and best practices change frequently‚Äîdate-sensitive content when appropriate
- **Cite sources**: Link to official documentation, research papers, or trusted organizations
- **Test recommendations**: Only recommend tools you've researched or used yourself

### Practical Considerations

- **Consider diverse threat models**: What works for one person may not work for another

- **Avoid assumptions**: Don't assume technical knowledge, financial resources, or specific devices

### What NOT to Include

- **Affiliate links or sponsored content**: This project is independent and ad-free
- **Untested or experimental tools**: Stick to well-established, trusted solutions
- **Illegal activities**: Focus on defensive security, not offensive techniques
- **Fear-mongering**: Be honest about risks without creating unnecessary panic
